# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Flight Delay Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview

In this demo, we‚Äôll assume the role of a Data Analyst for the Federal Aviation Administration üõ©Ô∏è. We‚Äôve been granted access to a comprehensive database containing nearly 2,000,000 commercial flights from major US airports. Our mission is to analyze this data to determine which flights were delayed or canceled, and uncover the reasons behind these disruptions.

Using **Power BI**, we‚Äôll transform the raw data into a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore flight delays and cancellations by airport, airline, day of the week, and more.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading & Transformation**: Efficiently load and clean the raw data, preparing it for analysis.
- **Relational Data Modeling**: Build a robust relational data model to ensure accurate and insightful analysis.
- **Calculated Columns & DAX Measures**: Add calculated columns and DAX measures to enhance the dataset and provide deeper insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard Design**: Create a visually stunning and interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to drill down into specific areas of interest.

## Workflow

1. **Load and Transform Data**:
   - Import data from multiple sources.
   - Cleanse and preprocess the data for analysis.
   - Ensure data quality and integrity.

2. **Build a Relational Data Model**:
   - Create relationships between tables.
   - Define primary and foreign keys.
   - Establish the foundation for accurate reporting.

3. **Add Calculated Columns & DAX Measures**:
   - Implement calculated columns for key metrics.
   - Develop DAX measures to perform complex calculations.
   - Optimize performance for large datasets.

4. **Design the Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Create a user-friendly interface with filters and slicers.
   - Use visuals like charts, graphs, and maps to present data.
   - Provide actionable insights with drill-through capabilities.

## Repository Structure

- **/data**: Contains the raw and transformed datasets.
- **/reports**: Includes the Power BI reports and dashboard files.
- **/scripts**: Holds any scripts or code used for data transformation.
- **/docs**: Contains documentation, including this README.
